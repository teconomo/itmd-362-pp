# Production Problem 09: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

1. Overall Design should give confidence to the user that it is legitamite and trustworthy
2. The main idea and job of the site is clearly stated
3. All major parts are accessible from home page
4. Touch areas are large enough for Precision
5. Forms should be as plain and as clear-cut as possible
6. Color should be in harmony of theme, brand and/or goal
7. Feedback is given for human interactions
8. Give tips and instructions when possible, but avoid unnecessary jargon
9. If a user's name is involved, make them feel welcomed by referring them by their name somewhere on the site.
10. Default options are given to reduce excess work
