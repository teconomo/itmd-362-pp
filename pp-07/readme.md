# Production Problem 07: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, GNOME, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Gnome Desktop:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL): https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dn742463.aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch: 

For interaction, I implemented both precision as well as Object-state. For Precision, it is shown through the fact that our attributes and items are large enough to not be a hassle when utilized on mobile scale such as through the text-boxes for Username and Password, as well as the Login submit button. For Object-state, we implemented a hover-state for desktop to add some aesthetically pleasing aspect to it.

* HCI Guidline Two (URL): https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742480(v=vs.85).aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch:

The second for the design was Visuals. Through this, it was mainly the Color aspect and Graphic elements. Color was for both the upper heading frame of the Form box as well as the login button which was a dark-red. We also gave transparency for the main Form box to display the Background image of IIT behind.  

* HCI Guidline Three (URL): https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dn742399.aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch:

The last Guideline was under Controls. Here, it was pretty straightforward as I used a "Default" command buttom as the Submit Button (default because if the user were to click Enter, it would submit.) We also used a Link for the "Forgot Password" aspect on our Login page.
