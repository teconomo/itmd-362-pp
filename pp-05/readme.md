## ITMD 362 Production Problem 5: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the color you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=53M0-0kds6A7thn7h9ij15DoE4g
Your Rationale: While most people would probably think of bright colors to relate the vibrance to the energy and vigor of playing video games and the enjoyment it brings, I believe the other side of the spectrum gives off a cooler look. I went with the blue with the dark purple and almost teal tint but shaded it almost completely out because for me, it gives off more of a sleek "elite" look of a game system. Very professional in my opinion compared to let's say a Wii which is white for pleasing normally a younger crowd. 

2. A triadic color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=32p0v0kbtrk3tJB79wkgamQkziL
Your Rationale: I went with a light olive green ( I think), along with a nice coral pink and a dark lavendar. All three of these colors honestly remind me of spring with the blossoming of plants, leaves, flowers, etc. This palette gives me a "new awakening" feel. 

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=33Z050kfkid8urJcxmDjWeNoIbd
Your Rationale: This one was kind of tough for me because I did not like any of the groupings. I was going for a darker look since when you think of a private messaging platform, you think of the terms "one on one", "privacy" etc. I went with this blueish-purple with a dull yellow because it somewhat mixes in enjoyment (yellow) but also privacy (darker colors: blue/purple).

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=100050kCViwsMrHvomvM8dRUg8j
Your Rationale: This one was pretty straightforward for me. Ruby on Rails has the word "Ruby" inside of it afterall! Ruby is a beautiful gemstone that has the powerful color of Red. However, I chose a intense but thick red tint because 

A. I don't want to blind viewers.
B. I want to match with how the gemstone may seem shiny and vibrant, but if you look at it closely, you can see a darker tint as you look into the mirroring of the gem void. 

* Hope you enjoyed my descriptive language... because I sure did..*
