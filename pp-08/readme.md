# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).

*Photo is of Apple Earbuds*

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: 

Visceral relates to our fast "affective" emotions towards something. For me, the reason I chose this item is because immediately, the first things my body (subconscious) think of is A. "it's obviously safe" and B. "it's simple and modernistic". It goes against all of the complications and heavy "bulk" that huge over-the-head headsets would have and puts my mind at ease without having it worry or overthink. 

* Behavioral:

This comes down to functionality overall. I passed the stage of "wow it's safe and it looks beautiful". Now I have to put it to the physical test itself. For me, these headphones are phenomenal because they get the job done; nice and simple. There are no huge gizmos or add-ons that I have to worry about to confuse me. You plug them in, and you have audio. Clean and crisp. The only added feature would be a small control for volume and a microphone for talking. 

* Reflective:

I've become used to this style of "audio hardware" now where, honest to God, I have a pair for my desk in my house, my backpack for school, and my gym-bag. I know I technically can go buy another pair of, let's say Samsung earbuds, and have probably the same audio but it's at the point now where I don't feel right without them for the task because I've always relied on them and they in turn, have always accomplished their duty.
